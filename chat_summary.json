The assistant also engaged the user with questions about their preferences for the generated image's stylistic theme and elements that may align with Taylor Swift's fandom culture, providing two options for each question. The user then requested a beautiful table showcasing all upcoming Taylor Swift concerts in the US, integrating a red glitter theme created using Tailwind CSS. The AI confirmed it\u2019s working on the table and asked for more details about the project. Throughout the interaction, the assistant ensured to involve the user in decisions and offered insights into additional functionalities.",
